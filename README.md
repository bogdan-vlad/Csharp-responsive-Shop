# Csharp-responsive-Shop

## Shop

This small shop or program has been created fully with C# in order to show to a beginner how the OOP works. The program
has a few items which they have been added to a StockBox in order to be able to purchase them. The purchase can be 
done by running the program without debugging and type what do you want to buy. The cash can be limited to any amount
and the maximum of products in the basket can be changed as well.
